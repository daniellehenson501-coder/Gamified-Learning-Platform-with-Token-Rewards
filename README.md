# 🎓 Gamified Learning Platform with Token Rewards

Welcome to an innovative Web3 platform that revolutionizes education by making learning fun, rewarding, and verifiable on the blockchain! This project addresses the real-world problem of low engagement and motivation in traditional learning systems, where students often lack incentives and verifiable proof of mastery. Using the Stacks blockchain and Clarity smart contracts, users can earn tokenized rewards for completing courses, passing quizzes, and demonstrating verified knowledge mastery, while educators can create content and earn from contributions.

## ✨ Features

🎯 Create and enroll in gamified courses with levels and badges  
🏆 Earn fungible tokens (e.g., LEARN tokens) for verified mastery of topics  
📊 Track progress with on-chain leaderboards and achievement NFTs  
🔍 Verify user knowledge through decentralized quizzes and oracle-integrated assessments  
💰 Stake tokens to boost rewards or participate in governance  
👥 Community voting for course approvals and updates  
🚫 Anti-cheating mechanisms with time-locked challenges  
📈 Token economy with burning and minting for sustainability
